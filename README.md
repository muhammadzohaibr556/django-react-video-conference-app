It provides user accounts for connecting multiple users.
<br/>
It works by creating offer and offer is send to all users in socket connection as well as candidate.
On other side, user recieves and set remote Description and Candidate, then answer is generated  
and send to all users as well as candidate.
<br/>
There are few things that donot work inaccurately but it works well between two users.
